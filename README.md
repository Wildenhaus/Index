# Reclaimer.Saber3D
A plugin for Reclaimer that adds support for Saber3D Engine Files

# Building
Reclaimer uses .NET Framework 4.6.2. This library uses .NET Standard 2.0.

The solution expects the Reclaimer source code to be in an adjacent folder.
Your directory structure should look something like this:

```
/Code
  /Reclaimer
  /Reclaimer.Saber3D
    Reclaimer.Saber3D.sln
```

If this isn't working, just remove the dependencies from the project and add new references to the Reclaimer projects.
